# Intro

The goal is to compute the correlations between sQTL beta and eQTL beta for top p vs. u sQTL top SNPs in a heatmap. It effectively summarises the 49 beta vs. beta scatter plots.

data:

1. p vs. u sQTL top SNPs
2. regression slope in sQTL mapping
3. regression slope in eQTL mapping

do this for each of the 49 tissues. Result is a 2x49 matrix where 

- row labels: u or p sQTL (2)
- col labels: tissue (49)
- values: correlation value of betas. 

plot heatmap: 

- split heatmap into 5 sub heatmaps, each is 2x10 (9) matrix
