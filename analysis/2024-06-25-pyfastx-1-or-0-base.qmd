# Does `pyfastx` use 0 or 1 based coordinates?


answer: pyfastx does use 1 based coordiantes for the fa.fetch() method. In addition, how stop codon and and transcripts were constructed needs scrutiny in because of how base is handled. 


```{python}
import os
import pyfastx
```


```{python}
print(os.getcwd())
```


```{python}
fa_file = './test.fa'

```

```{python}
with open(fa_file) as f:
  fa_text = f.readlines()
```

```{python}
  fa_text
```


```{python}
fa = pyfastx.Fasta(fa_file)
```



```{python}
for seq in fa:
  print(seq.name)
  print(seq.seq)
  print(seq.description)
  print('\n\n')
```


```{python}
fa.fetch('JZ822577.1', (1,6))
```

```{python}
fa.fetch('JZ822577.1', (1,6), strand = '-')
```
